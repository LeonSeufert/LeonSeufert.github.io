       <div id= "topbar"><h1 id="Work">WORK</h1> <p>During Lockdown I had two assignments to work on. The first was based in Pro Tools where we had to edit a multi track drum recording as seen on the left. Each individual track is signified by its individual colour and waveform and you can see on the left what element of the drum kit each track correlates to. The second was an assignment based in Ableton where we had to create an original composition with a focus on immersion, my partner and I decided to base our composition on a festival experience making use of various foley sounds and panning in order to create the feeling of someone moving from stage to stage.</p></div>

   <h2>21 Moon Water - Bon Iver</h2>
        
        <p class= "page3Para">
Despite the difference in vibe between what we want to achieve with our festival based piece and this ambiguous evolving piece, the use of random panned voices floating in the distance during the intro I believe is something we could draw inspiration from when trying to communicate the internal monologue of our character moving through the event. This coupled with the slowly moving harmonic elements gives off an image of all these random chops and samples floating in a bed setting a strong atmosphere. We would hope to emulate this by communicating how our character is feeling with random sounds acting as thoughts racing through their head.
  
</p>
    <h2>Nangs - Tame impala</h2>
        <p class= "page3Para">The synth elements prominent throughout the entire track are something we are hoping to emulate in our piece, we are aiming for our character to have moods that change throughout the festival and this would be communicated through similar synthetic elements droning throughout the song. In particular the intros pulsing synth is a perfect example of the type of sound we would use to communicate the feeling of intense chemical influence  in our character. The way the entire piece carries an out of this world and synthetic quality and how it plays into the soundscape and mood of the track is also something we are inspired by and are looking to tap into in our own way.
</p>
     <h2>Del Fuego - Fat Freddy's Drop</h2>
 <p class= "page3Para">The unusual percussion sounds and beating low end in this track do an excellent job of setting the environment of the song. The intro with its heartbeat like pulse, foreshadowing hi-hat and what sounds like rocks being tapped together sets an image of a cold blue river making the introduction of the acoustic guitar very welcoming and warm in contrast. The bed of complementary sounds that layer on top sets in stone this theme as the vocals come in. The way this track sets such a clear stage with its sound selection is something we will draw inspiration from when making our track.</p>
     <h2>Nights - Frank Ocean</h2>   
 <p class= "page3Para">This tracks ability to communicate different feelings and states through its soundscape is something we will try to capture in our piece. It will be relatively easy for us to communicate the physical change of environment in our track through moving through different stages however the internal feelings of our character will be much harder to capture and the pleasant way Nights blends different moods into one journey is a perfect point of inspiration for how to use motifs in music. I also enjoy the use of panning in this track to create the feeling of chaos during the final climax.   </p>
